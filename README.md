## ðŸŽ‰ Deployment Status

**âœ… DEPLOYED TO BATOCERA (GALAGA - 192.168.1.53)**

The Anki Deck Viewer is now live! Access it at: **http://192.168.1.53:5000**

See [DEPLOYMENT-COMPLETE.md](DEPLOYMENT-COMPLETE.md) for full details and next steps.

## Quick Start

### Deploy Anki Viewer to Batocera

**âœ… Already Deployed!** The app is ready at `/userdata/roms/anki` on your Batocera device.

### One-Time Setup: SSH Keys (Faster Deployments)

To avoid entering passwords during deployment, set up SSH key authentication:

```cmd
setup-ssh-key.bat
```

This will:
- Generate an SSH key if you don't have one
- Copy it to GALAGA for password-less access
- Only needs to be done once

After this, deployments are much faster with fewer password prompts!

### Install/Update from GitHub (Recommended)

To install or update to the latest version from https://github.com/mbolaris/anki:

**From Windows:**
```cmd
deploy-anki-from-github.bat
```

**From Batocera (SSH):**
```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.53
cd /userdata/roms/anki
./install-from-github.sh
```

**For clean install (removes existing):**
```cmd
deploy-anki-from-github.bat clean
```

This will:
- Clone the latest version from GitHub
- Install to `/userdata/roms/anki`
- Preserve your deck files in `/userdata/roms/anki/decks/`
- Restart the Flask app automatically

### Alternative Deployment Methods

**Option 1: Using Make**
```powershell
cd c:\shared\bolaris\galga-batocera
make deploy BATOCERA_HOST=192.168.1.53
```

**Option 2: Using SMB Share (Manual)**
1. Copy deployment scripts to `\\BATOCERA\share\roms\anki\`
2. SSH into Batocera and run the GitHub installer:
   ```bash
   cd /userdata/roms/anki
   ./install-from-github.sh
   ```

### Access the App

Once deployed and running:
- **Web interface:** `http://192.168.1.53:5000`
- **EmulationStation:** Select "Anki Deck Viewer" from menu
- **SSH:** `ssh root@192.168.1.53` then `cd /userdata/roms/anki`

## Development

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](share/roms/anki/DEVELOPMENT.md) for complete development workflow guide.

**Quick commands:**
```powershell
make deploy         # Deploy files
make restart        # Deploy and restart Flask
make update         # Deploy and update dependencies
make status         # Check Flask status
make logs           # View logs
make logs-follow    # Follow logs in real-time
make shell          # SSH into Batocera
```

**VSCode integration:**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to deploy and restart
- Press `F5` to run Flask locally
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Tasks: Run Task" for more options

## Batocera Guidelines

Files under `share/` mirror the SMB `\\BATOCERA\\share` area and are safe to copy to the device's `share` partition or edit directly from the PC.

**Key Principles:**
- Batocera uses a read-only Buildroot system
- User data lives in `/userdata` (mounted from `share` partition)
- No `apt` or system package managers available
- Use self-contained solutions (venvs, flatpak, static binaries)
- Custom apps go in `/userdata/roms/ports` or custom system directories
- EmulationStation config overlays in `/userdata/system/configs/emulationstation/`

See [agents.md](agents.md) for complete guidelines.

## Contributing

This repository follows Batocera best practices:
1. All customizations are self-contained in `/userdata`
2. No base system modifications
3. Portable and reproducible
4. Version controlled with Git

See [agents.md](agents.md) for contributor guidelines.
